> one’s genetic information cannot be changed at will—once it is leaked, it stays leaked. [source](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1741-0)

> most data analysis workflows in biomedicine currently lack privacy-preserving alternatives that scale to real-world settings. [source](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1741-0)

> Preventive measures to mitigate privacy risks in biomedicine are sometimes regarded as a nuisance in scientific research, limiting researchers’ access to data.
