# Genomic Data Security

> one’s genetic information cannot be changed at will—once it is leaked, it stays leaked. [source](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1741-0)

> most data analysis workflows in biomedicine currently lack privacy-preserving alternatives that scale to real-world settings. [source](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1741-0)

> Preventive measures to mitigate privacy risks in biomedicine are sometimes regarded as a nuisance in scientific research, limiting researchers’ access to data. [source](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1741-0)


Individual’s germline genomic data provide information that can uniquely identify individuals and tend to remain relatively static over the course of life, providing excellent biometric information (i.e., genomic “fingerprint”). [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7761157/) 

Sharing seemingly harmless “aggregate” data (e.g., allele statistics) can also pose privacy risks. [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7761157/) 

Traditional privacy models designed for health data, provide limited protection for genomic data. [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7761157/) 

An attacker may learn sensitive information about a target individual by exploiting the dependency between genomic data and other publicly available information such as: family name, demographic data, and observable features (e.g., eyes and hair color). [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7761157/) 

...companies collect data from a growing number of individuals, some of whom may share their data without fully understanding the potential implications for themselves, existing and future blood relatives. [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7761157/) 


it is imperative to ensure privacy...as a fundamental right for individuals...[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7761157/)
